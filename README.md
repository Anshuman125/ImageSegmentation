# PyTorch Image Masking Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a PyTorch-based Image Masking Project. The project focuses on image segmentation and the creation of accurate masks for objects in images. It leverages PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework, to train and deploy a neural network for image segmentation tasks.

## Features

- **Image Segmentation:** Utilize deep learning techniques to perform image segmentation and create masks for objects in images.

- **PyTorch Implementation:** Leverage the flexibility and power of PyTorch for building and training neural networks.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Implement effective data preprocessing techniques to prepare the dataset for training.

- **Model Architecture:** Employ state-of-the-art neural network architectures for image segmentation tasks.

- **Visualization:** Tools for visualizing input images, ground truth masks, and model predictions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- GPU (CPU can also work but will be a bit slow)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository for dataset:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/parth1620/Human-Segmentation-Dataset-master.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install torch
    pip install sklearn
    pip install segmentation-models-pytorch
    pip install -U git+https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations
    pip install --upgrade opencv-contrib-python
    pip install ssl
    ```

### Usage

 Train the model:
    
    r"Human-Segmentation-Dataset-master/train.csv"

    
## Features

- **Semantic Segmentation:** Train a deep learning model to perform pixel-level segmentation of objects in images.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Utilities for loading and preprocessing image and mask data.
- **Model Architecture:** Implement a customizable neural network architecture for image masking.
